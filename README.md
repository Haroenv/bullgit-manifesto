# the bullgit manifesto

[Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) did it wrong - this is the bullgit manifesto

- **bullgit** is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.
- **bullgit** is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.
- **bullgit** must enrich the lives of individual *gitches*.
- *gitches’* security and privacy at **bullgit** are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.
- *gitches* must have the ability to shape **bullgit** and their own experiences in it.
- The effectiveness of **bullgit** as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and decentralized participation worldwide.
- Free and open source software promotes the development of **bullgit** as a public resource.
- *shitty* community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.
- Commercial involvement in the development of **bullgit** brings no benefits; an unbalance between commercial profit and public benefit is critical.
- Magnifying the public benefit aspects of **bullgit** is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.
